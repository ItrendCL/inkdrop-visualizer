# Inkdrop Chrome Extension

The Inkdrop Chrome Extension complements our [GitHub Action for visualizing Terraform plans](https://github.com/your-org/your-repo). It enables users to seamlessly transition from static diagrams in pull request comments into interactive, exploratory visualizations within their Chrome browser. 

## Key Functionality

- **Interactive Exploration**: Dive into your infrastructure changes with an intuitive, graphical interface directly in your browser.

## Installation and Usage

2. Navigate to a pull request within your project that includes a commented diagram from the Inkdrop GH Action.
3. Click on the diagram image commented in the PR to open its interactive version.
